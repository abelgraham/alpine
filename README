DISTRIBUTION CONTENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This Alpine distribution includes:

alpine     - The Alpine source directory
configure  - Script to set system-specific configuration, defaults
contrib    - Contributed ports and additions
doc        - Documentation directory. The main documentation is tech-notes.txt
imap	   - Source tree containing C-Client IMAP implementation
m4         - macros used in the configure process
packages   - Scripts for building packages for various Linux distributions
pico       - The Pico and Pilot source directory
pith       - Core functions common to Alpine/Web Alpine
po         - localization data
web        - Source and scripts for web-based version of Alpine

Most of the documentation is in doc/tech-notes.txt. It is not user
level documentation, but there are things in it some users might find
useful.  The directory doc/tech-notes contains source for
doc/tech-notes.txt in HTML format which can be viewed via a Web
browser by opening doc/tech-notes/index.html.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PRELIMINARIES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this, you have presumably succeeded in extracting
the distribution from the compressed tar archive file, via the following 
command, or equivalent:

        tar zxf alpine.tar.z

Some of the instructions that follow assume that your current workding
directory is the alpine-X.XX directory created by the un-tar process
above.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD PROCESS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpine build process uses GNU autoconf.  It should be sufficient to build
alpine by typing the commands:

        ./configure
        make

For a list of configuration options and default settings type:

       ./configure --help   


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
RESULTING EXECUTABLES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The executables produced are:

 alpine The Alpine mailer. Once compiled this should work just fine on
        your system with no other files than this binary, and no
        modifications to your system. Optionally you may create two
        configuration files, /usr/local/lib/pine.conf and 
        /usr/local/lib/pine.info. See the documentation for details.
 
 pico   The standalone editor similar to the Alpine message composer.
        This is a very simple straight forward text editor.
 
 pilot  The standalone file system navigator.

 alpined
        The Web Alpine serveret which manages the 
 
 imapd  The IMAP daemon. If you want to run alpine in client/server mode,
        this is the daemon to run on the server. Installing this
        requires system privileges and modifications to /etc/services.
        See doc/tech-notes for more details.
 
 mtest  The test IMAP client, an absolutely minimal mail client, useful
        for debugging.

 rpload Utility for uploading a local pinerc or address book to an IMAP
	server.

 rpdump Utility for downloading a pinerc or address book to the
	local machine.

 mailutil 
	Utility for performing various operations on mailboxes,
	be they local or remote.

In general "make install" should place alpine, pico and pilot, and
their corresponding man pages, in the proper directory for your
system.  As the remaining binaries are intended for specific uses or
are a component of a larger package, their installation is typically
done by hand.
