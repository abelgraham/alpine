Alpine Release Highlights
</DIV>

<DIV STYLE="background-color: white; padding: 24; margin: 20; border: 1px solid black">
Based on user feedback, the latest Alpine has many changes.
Improvements include an Export/Import command to save folders to your
desktop or forward them to other Alpine users, easier ways to number
messages, a jump command to access a specific message, a more convenient way to save messages,
color controls
for various parts of a message, and control over the width of text in
messages.
<P>
<H2>April 2006 Update:</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Minor Bug Fixes</DT>

<DD>Most notable: View, Reply and Forward of non-ASCII text 
improved, support for secondary IMAP server access restored.
</DD>

<P>

<H2>December 2005 Update:</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Accidental Folder Expunge</DT>
<DD>In addition to bug fixes, this new version of Alpine adds extra
safeguards in the form of a renamed button [Mark All in Folder] and an
icon above the message list that marks only those messages on the
current page. Plus it includes an extra error handler if you try to
delete all the messages in a folder without first checking a
permission box

<P>

<H2>August 2005 Update:</H2>

<DL>
<DT>Export/Import Controls</DT>
<DD>    You can now export entire folders to your desktop and later recall
    (import) them.  Among other things, it lets you reduce your usage of
    C&C central storage space and allows you to forward entire folders to
    another Alpine user.
</DD>

<DT>Index Display</DT>
<DD>    You can much more easily control the way messages in a folder are
    listed (the index display).
</DD>

<DT>Jump Command</DT>
<DD>    You can turn on an option that lets you jump to a specific message in
    a folder.  To turn on the option, see "Enable Jump Command" in
    [Configure] > [General] You'll have to quit and then restart
    Alpine, and, of course, Jump only makes sense if message numbering
    is enabled.
</DD>

<DT>Save Command</DT>
<DD>    You can more conveniently save messages to a folder by selecting a
    folder name from a drop-down list of up to six frequently used folders.
</DD>

<DT>Color Controls</DT>
<DD>    Color controls let you control the colors of various elements and
    their backgrounds in a message. See "Color Settings" in
    [Configure] > [Message View].
</DD>

<DT>Text Width Controls</DT>
<DD>    You can now specifically control the width of lines of text in Alpine
    to insure that text is well formatted when it is displayed by the
    receiving email program.  See "Display Width (in Characters)"
    in [Configure] > [General].
